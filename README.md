# Euler Project Problem Solutions

In this repo you can find the solutions I've come up with for the last problems I've solved from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

The goal of solving these problems was to understand a bit more about algorithms and data-structures while learning Python. On the other hand, some of the problems presented in the website are super interesting.

The [snippets](./euler_snippets.py) file contains some helper functions I used to solve some of the first 50 problems.

## Problems:

- [Pandigital Prime](./ex41e.py)
- [Coded Triangle Numbers](./ex42e.py)
- [Sub-string Divisibility](./ex43e.py)
- [Pentagon Numbers](./ex44e.py)
- [Triangular, Pentagonal and Hexagonal](./ex45e.py)
- [Goldbach's Other Conjecture](./ex46e.py)
- [Distinct Primes Factors](./ex47e.py)
- [Self Powers](./ex48e.py)
- [Prime Permutations](./ex49e.py)
- [Consecutive Prime Sum](./ex50e.py)
